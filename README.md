## Introduction

Fraudulent activities, such as credit card fraud, can result in significant financial losses. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time is crucial to mitigate these risks. This machine learning model utilizes the Random Forest Classifier to identify potentially fraudulent transactions based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this model is provided in the 'fraudTest.csv' file. It contains transaction data with features such as transaction time, location, and transaction amount. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and balance the class distribution using SMOTE.

## Usage

To use this fraud detection model:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (see Dependencies section).
3. Run the provided Python script, which includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
4. View the model's performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and accuracy.

Feel free to customize the model, hyperparameters, or use different datasets to suit your specific fraud detection needs.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and balancing the dataset using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). These steps are crucial for preparing the data for machine learning.

## Model Training

The Random Forest Classifier is used as the machine learning algorithm for fraud detection. The model is trained on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and make predictions.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and accuracy. These metrics help assess how well the model can identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

## Results

The model's performance metrics are provided in the README or as part of the repository documentation. Users can analyze these results to determine the model's effectiveness in fraud detection.
